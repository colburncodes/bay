The goal is build our very own custom Docker container image. 
And it will be from scratch, bare bones, with an empty Dockerfile, and 
we will create, build, and run our very own custom Docker Image.

By doing so, My goal is to introduce you to some commands
when building and maintaining images with Docker.


But first let's understand:
- What is Docker?
- What is a Container?
- What is an Image?

### Install Docker
To install docker, see [Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
