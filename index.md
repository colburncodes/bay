Hello! My name is <b>Colburn Sanders</b>. I grew up in North Carolina. Currently I'm working in GovTech
as a full stack engineer <b><h2>I build systems that solve problems</h2></b> 
I specialize in creating software for clients ranging from individuals and small-businesses even
large enterprise corporations.

Apart from working, I travel, run, spend time with family, trying new foods, and take some pictures.
