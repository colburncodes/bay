<p>
Hello! My name is Colburn Sanders. I grew up in North Carolina. I'm currently working in GovTech
as a full stack engineer. And I help a handful of greenfield projects that I believe in, or that I'm 
passionate about.

Apart from working, I travel, run, spend time with family, and trying new foods.
