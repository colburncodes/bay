Hi, Hello, and Welcome. My name is <b>Colburn Sanders</b>. 
I am a Software Engineer in St. Louis, MO. I have been programming professionally for more than 5 years, and I hope I will inspire others to make their own creative corner!
</p>

<h2><b>I like to build systems that solve problems & building things that empower
others to do the same.</b></h2>

Currently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer for
[New Balance](https://newbalance.com) where I work with payment processing, order management, and fraud validation.

<p>
I specialize in creating software for clients ranging from individuals and small-businesses even
large enterprise corporations.
</p>

<p>
Apart from working, I travel, run, spend time with family, trying new foods, and take some pictures.
</p>
