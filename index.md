Hello, and welcome to my doc site. My name is <b>Colburn Sanders</b>. 
I am a Software Engineer in St. Louis, MO. I have been programming professionally for more than 5 years, and I still love to code!
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer for New Balance where I work with payment processing, order management, and fraud validation.
</p>

<h2><b>I like to build systems that solve problems & building things that empower
others to do the same.</b></h2>
<p>
I specialize in creating software for clients ranging from individuals and small-businesses even
large enterprise corporations.
</p>

<p>
Apart from working, I travel, run, spend time with family, trying new foods, and take some pictures.
