Hi, Hello, and Welcome. My name is <b>Colburn Sanders</b>. 
I am a Software Engineer in St. Louis, MO. I have been programming professionally for more than 5 years, and I hope I will inspire others to make their own creative corner!
</p>

<h2><b>I like to build systems that solve problems & building things that empower
others to do the same.</b></h2>

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at
[New Balance](https://newbalance.com), focusing on optimizing the checkout order flow and ensuring the performance
of our systems.
<p>
I also provide production support for order management and export. In my spare time, I enjoy working out
and spending time with my girls.
