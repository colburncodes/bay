<p>
Hello! My name is <b>Colburn</b>. I grew up in North Carolina. I'm currently working in GovTech
as a full stack engineer with a background interest in cloud technologies, distributed systems, and web applications.
</p>
<h2><b>I build systems that solve problems & building things that empower
others to do the same.</b></h2>
<p>
I specialize in creating software for clients ranging from individuals and small-businesses even
large enterprise corporations.
</p>

<p>
Apart from working, I travel, run, spend time with family, trying new foods, and take some pictures.
